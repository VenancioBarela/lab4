"""
This program allos a user three tries to guess the correct answer to the question
question (q) = "what is the capital of california". The answer (a) is "Sacramento".

we first set the max tries = 3. Then we create a loop to iterate three times. For each iteration, we ask the user for the answer (user input). 
Then based on the answer given we check to see if the user input matches the answer.
If so, print "Correct!", then terminate the loop with a break statement.

If the user could not answer the question with the max attempts, then print "You have used up your allotment of guesses.", 
then print "The correct answer is "Sacramento".
